when activate lock entry boxes until restart
change year 
    set needs of animals
        make array with number of deer given
        deer[i] = random number between 1 and 3
    math time
        check how many of each thing we need 
            have 5W 5F 5S
            need 3W 4F 9S
        then do math 
            water loses 3
            food loses 4
            shelter loses 5 
            IF ANY NEGATIVE
                kill that many deer (shelter = -4 so four deer die)
                then make 4(number of deer that died) new elements 1 to 3
            then multiply the current number of deer by 2
RINSE AND REPEAT
